# Confectionery Cakeshop #

This is my capstone project for Code Kentucky's web development course part 1. This project is a website for a bakery. Essentially uou should be able to place orders on the website with other information on there as well for the user to find out everything they need to know about the bakery. The logo for the bakery was designed by me. For the site to work properly, it has to be opened using the live server in VS code.

The project requirements were:
* Project must be visually appealing.
* You must include a minimum of 2 media queries that create a better layout/user experience.
* Project is uploaded to your GitHub repository and shows at minimum 5 separate commits.
* Project must be a fully formed website with headers, footers, and body sections.
* HTML must be your best efforts at being semantic.
* Choose at least 3 options from the list below, consider a 4th option in-case one malfunctions.
* All projects must use either flexbox or grid for the page layout.
* All projects must take best efforts to be accessible.

The 4 features that are included in the site are:
1. Create a responsive menu wth JavaScript.
2. Add your own transition animation(s) to an element on hover.
3. Create a simple hide/show div with CSS.
4. Create accordion boxes to display different types of information.
